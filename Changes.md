- Submission count added to submission pages (in lieu of providing every bit of submission data)
- Event archive added with proper nav. in place
- General refractoring (good stuff that nobody else care about...)

Added table for event-user association. Possibly going to use this for adding organisers to events, such that they can delete/modify/view entries in given events (i.e., so they can *organise* it).

Considering doing accolades as purely numerical, following the formula `m - 2p + 1`, where `m` is the count of entries and `p` is the position of the scored item. This way, player scores can be tallied together in one scoresheet without winners in a contest of 5 entries being scored equally to a winner in a contest of 50 entries.

It'd also be easier to implement.

Made vote records more generalised, such that the addition of a private judging round can happen. Also considering the possibility of using votes on artworks, though how that ties in to event flow... I'm not sure. Something to ponder, but not a top priority in any case.

Fic submissions require a login. Art submissions don't, but you won't be able to manipulate your submissions without one. Art rounds and prelim rounds are both optional on a per-event basis.

I suspect that dealing with the vote distribution will take longer than other components, since a nice interface to the voting will take a bit of javascript magic. That said, the main algorithm for participant distributions is already written from earlier; it just needs a little wrapping to be more modular.

The only thing that isn't trivial is the volunteer distribution. I'm still thinking about how I should handle that. Suggestions are welcome.
